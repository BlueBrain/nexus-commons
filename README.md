## Nexus Commons

The project is a collection of small libraries used for building nexus services.

### Building the project

The project depends on the [sbt nexus](https://github.com/bluebrain/sbt-nexus) plugin.  Until a stable version of the
plugin is released, in order to build the project, the plugin needs to be published locally.
